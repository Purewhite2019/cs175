This is the assignment of Chapter 2 in CS175, *Practice on Android Application Development*, Autumn 2021.

A cat adoption application demo, with the following features:

- [x] Display the abstract information of each lovely cat in a scrolling manner.
- [x] Search bar is applied to facilitate users to find their ideal pet more conveniently.
- [x] Detailed information of each cat is able to access by clicking its abstraction, and clicking the `back` button can bring a user back to the search window.

This whole project is implemented in *Kotlin* in nearly 5 hours, mainly wrestling with grammars of *Kotlin* and tricks of *RecyclerView*.

If time permits, some extra ideas may be realize:

- [ ] Add the thumbnail of each cat in its abstract item. 

- [ ] Use *Jetpack Compose* to reimplement this project.
- [ ] Or more crazily, fully develop this application to turn it from a toy into a utility software and release it to Google Play!
